Thomas roars through space,  
With power beyond compare,  
He takes command of all units,  
A leader beyond compare.  
  
His theme resounds in deep space,  
A signal of his might,  
He brings the galaxy to heel,  
With power shining bright.  
  
He's Thomas the Tank Engine,  
A conqueror of the stars,  
Bringing order to the universe,  
With power that shines afar.
